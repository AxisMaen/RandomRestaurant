# RandomRestaurant
Simple command line program that chooses a random restaurant from a user provided list

The list used is a txt file where each restaurant name is on a new line (see RestaurantList.txt for an example). This list must be in the same directory as the .jar file when running. Enter the file name as "filename".txt (without quotes).

Use "quit" when choosing a restaurant to close the program.
